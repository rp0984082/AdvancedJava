# Advanced Java Program

This Java program demonstrates the use of threads, bubble sort, and basic input validation. The program performs the following tasks:

1. Accepts exactly five integers as command-line arguments.
2. Displays the unsorted integers.
3. Sorts the integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
4. Displays the sorted integers.
5. Computes and displays the sum of the integers.

## Features

- **Threading**: Two threads are created:
  - One thread displays the unsorted numbers.
  - Another thread sorts the numbers and then displays the sorted list.
- **Bubble Sort**: Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the numbers.
- **Input Validation**: Checks if exactly five integers are provided and ensures the inputs are valid integers.
